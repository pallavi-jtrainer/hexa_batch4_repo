Git Continued: (the information about these commands is available in the book I have shared as well as the pdf shared by Hexaware with you.)
git stash -> to stash uncommited files before switching into another branch
	-- look up the various options with this command 

git pull -> to get the latest updates from the branch

git branch -> git branch <branch name> -> creates a child branch

git checkout -b <branchname> -> creates a child branch and switches to it

git merge -> adds the contents of the child branch to the master branch and removes the child branch

git rebase -> used to reset the starting point of the child branch with the master branch

git checkout
	git checkoout <filename> -> unstages a file from staging area
	git checkout <branch name> -> to switch branches

git diff
	- to check the difference between files
	git diff branch1..branch2 -> to check differences between 2 branches

git log -> to check the logs. Type q to quit the logs

Steps to handle Merge conflict
1. git checkout master
2. git pull
3. git checkout <your branch name>
4. git rebase -i master
      -> any conflicts between your changes and changes in the files in master will appear now. 
      -> Open the files in VS Code or vi editor or in any editor of your choice.
      ->  go through the changes one by one, and resolve the conflicts.
          -> Merge conflicts are highlighted with `<<<` and `>>>` markers
	  -> delete the markers
               then -> git add <file in conflict>
                    -> git rebase --continue


Multi-tier architecture
Presentation - Angular (web framework)
	Rest Service - war (Web Archive)
Business - Java
Persistence - DB

mvn -> maven -> Java framework

Steps are in Week1.md for the below set of commands

2. Open File explorer
3. Goto the project folder\MLP23X\LMS_BusinessComponent\leavemanager\target
4. Copy MLP23X-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war
5. Paste it in apache-tomcat-x.x.x\webapps folder
6. Rename the file to MLP23X.war
7. Go to the previous folder (apache-tomcat-x.x.x)
8. Open git bash here
9. At the command prompt type in the below commands
	rm -rf logs/*
	./bin/startup.sh
	tail -f logs/*
10. Minimize this git bash window
11. Open a second git bash window. type in the below command
	curl -vvv http://localhost:8080/MLP23X/api/employees | python -m json.tool
   -- this command should open the URL in the default browser and show the list of employee ids
12. Next type the below command in the git bash window
	curl -vvv http://localhost:8080/MLP23X/api/employees/2000 | python -m json.tool
