DataStructures
1. Based on how the data is stored
	Linear
	Non-linear
2. Based on memory allocation 
	Static 
	Dynamic

Linear Datastructure
1. Stack
2. queue
	Deque
	Priority Queue
3. Linked Lists
	Doubly linked list
	Singly linked list
	Circular linked list
4. Arrays

Non-linear
1. Tree
	Binary
		balanced
		unbalanaced
			left
			right
	Forest
	B+
	recursion
	decision
2. Graph
	directed
	undirected


Static
1. Array - fixed size

Dynamic
All DS except Arrays



STACK
Last In First Out - LIFO
push -> add item
pop -> remove item
Traversal -> linear

QUEUE
First In first Out - FIFO
add -> adds item in the end
remove -> removes item from front

	DEQUE - >double ended Q
	add_front, add_end
	remove_front, remove_end

	Priority Q -> each item has a priority
	add
	remove
Traversal -> linear

LINKED LIST
nodes -> 2 parts (data, address of next node)
head -> starting point
add_front, add_last, add_middle
remove_front, remove_last, remove_middle
Traversal -> linear
	Singly Linked List -> every node has 1 node only associated
	Doubly Linked List -> every node is connected to node before and node after
	Circular Linked List -> last node points to the first node

BINARY TREE
	Root node, child node, leaf node
	
Traversals
	BFS - Breadth First Search
	DFS - Depth First Search
		In Order Left-Root-Right
		Post Order Left-Right-Root
		Pre Order Root-Left-Right

BST - Binary Search Tree
	All elements less than root -> left
	All greater than root -> right

Graph
	node (Vertex), edge
