Angular
 -> framework
 -> dynamic web applications
 -> open-source
 -> Single page applications (SPA)

Angular Architecture
	NgModule -> basic building block of angular -> compilation context for component

Parts
	1. Modules
	2. Components
	3. Templates
	4. Directives
	5. Services
	6. Data-binding

component has a template which defines the view
this template combines the HTML and the angular directives

	component based architecture

Component lifecycle - 8 stages
  1. ngOnChanges -> executes everytime a value of an input control in the component changes
  2. ngOnInit -> fired only once. 
  3. ngDoCheck -> will check the input values to the component properties
  4. ngAfterContentInit -> executes when all the binding of a component have to checked for the first time. fires only once
  5. ngAfterContentChecked -> executes after every change detected by the Angular framework
  6. ngAfterViewInit -> executes when the component completes the rendering of the view to the browser
  7. ngAfterViewChecked -> executed when the change detected is rendered on screen
  8. ngOnDestroy -> executed to delete or destroy a component. Called only once
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data Binding
 -> mechanism for connecting the user interface and the backend (data) 
 -> 4 types
	-> two way
	-> interpolation (one way)
	-> property binding
	-> event binding
